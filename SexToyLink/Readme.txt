 FAQ
------------
Q: Is my sex toy supported?
A: To confirm that your sex toy will work check the following:
    1. Go to https://iostindex.com/, search for your toy and confirm that in the "Buttplug.io Support" column it has "C#"
    2. Currently only vibration control is implemented in this app, so your toy must have vibration.

Q: Can this app control more than one toy at once?
A: The code was written to support multiple toys at the same time, but the author only has one toy, so this functionality is untested. Feedback is welcome.

Q: My sex toy doesn't work!
A: To resolve this please do the following:
    1. Check that it's supported (check above)
    2. Click scan. Wait until it appears in the list. Leave the checkbox checked. Click Control. Drag the slider to test.

Q: What is Degrees of Lewdity and where do I get it ?
A: Degrees of Lewdity is an erotic game. You play an 18-year-old boy or girl in a town full of people with lewd intentions. 
Go to school and find honest work, turn to a life of crime, or sell your body in more carnal ways. 
For more information and download links, please check the developer's blog at https://vrelnir.blogspot.com/

Q: The window for Degress of Lewdity is too small, how can I play like that?
A: You can resize the window by draging on corners, or simply maximize it by double clicking the top bar, or clicking the maximize button.
